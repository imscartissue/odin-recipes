    <h2>Recipe for making sausage</h2>

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds (about 900 grams) of ground meat (such as pork, beef, or a combination)</li><br>
        <li>1/4 cup ice water</li><br>
        <li>1/2 teaspoons salt</li><br>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li><br>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder (or minced fresh garlic)</li><br>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder (or finely chopped onions)</li><br>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried herbs (such as thyme, sage, or rosemary) - optional</li><br>
        <li>Natural sausage casings, soaked in water (if making link sausages)</li><br>
        <li>Cooking oil (for pan-frying or grilling)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Steps:</h4>

    <ol>

        <li>Start with cold, freshly ground meat. You can either grind your meat using a meat grinder or buy ground meat from your local butcher.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Ensure that the meat is well-chilled; this makes it easier to work with.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground meat, ice water, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and any optional herbs you'd like to use.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Mix the ingredients thoroughly until the seasoning is evenly distributed throughout the meat. You can use your hands or a mixer with a paddle attachment.</li>
        <br>
        <li>To check the seasoning, cook a small portion of the sausage mixture in a pan and taste it. Adjust the seasonings if needed.</li>
        <br>
        <li>If you want to make link sausages, carefully thread the natural sausage casings onto a sausage stuffer or a sausage attachment for a meat grinder. Rinse the casings thoroughly with water to remove any excess salt.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Stuff the meat mixture into the casings, leaving a little space at the ends for twisting or tying.</li>
        <br>
        <li>If you're making patties or loose sausage, shape the seasoned meat mixture into patties or simply leave it loose for ground sausage.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat a skillet or frying pan over medium heat with a little cooking oil. Add the sausages and cook until they're browned on all sides and cooked through. This usually takes about 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Once your sausages are cooked to your liking, remove them from the heat.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Serve your homemade sausages hot with your favorite accompaniments, such as mustard, sauerkraut, or freshly baked bread.</li>
