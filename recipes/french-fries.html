    <h2>Recipe for making french fries</h2>

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>4 large russet potatoes</li><br>
        <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li><br>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li><br>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Steps:</h4>

    <ol>

        <li>Start by peeling the potatoes. You can leave the skin on for a rustic look if you prefer.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Rinse the peeled potatoes under cold water to remove any excess starch.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pat the potatoes dry with a clean kitchen towel.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Slice the potatoes into even-sized matchsticks or strips. You can use a knife or a mandoline slicer for this. Aim for a thickness of about 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place the potato strips in a large bowl of cold water. This helps remove excess starch, which can make the fries less crispy.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or a deep fryer, add enough vegetable oil to submerge the fries. Heat the oil to around 350-375°F (175-190°C).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Remove the potato strips from the water and pat them thoroughly dry with paper towels. Moisture can cause the hot oil to splatter.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Carefully add a handful of potato strips to the hot oil, ensuring they are not overcrowded. Fry in batches if necessary.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Fry the potatoes for about 3-4 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Use a slotted spoon or a wire mesh strainer to remove the fries from the oil and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.</li>

        <br>
        <li>Once all the fries are fried and salted, transfer them to a serving platter.</li>
        <br>
        <li>You can serve them as-is or with your choice of condiments, such as ketchup, mayonnaise, or vinegar.</li>
