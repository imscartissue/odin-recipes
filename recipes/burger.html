    <h2>Recipe for making burger</h2>

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>

    <ul>
        
        <li>1 pound (450 grams) ground beef (80% lean)</li><br>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li><br>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li><br>
        <li>4 slices of cheese (optional)</li><br>
        <li>Lettuce leaves</li><br>
        <li>Sliced tomatoes</li><br>
        <li>Sliced onions</li><br>
        <li>Pickles (optional)</li><br>
        <li>Ketchup and mustard, or your favorite condiments</li><br>
        <li>Cooking oil (for grilling or pan-frying)</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>

    <ol>

        <li>Start with cold ground beef. If you like, you can season the meat with a little salt and freshly ground black pepper. Be gentle when handling the meat to avoid over-packing it, which can make the burgers tough.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Divide the ground beef into four equal portions.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Gently shape each portion into a patty, about 1/2 to 3/4 inch (1.3 to 2 cm) thick.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Make a slight depression in the center of each patty with your thumb; this will help prevent the burgers from puffing up during cooking.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Season both sides of each patty with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Preheat your grill or a skillet (if you're pan-frying) over medium-high heat. Add a little cooking oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place the patties on the grill or in the skillet.</li>
        <br>
        <li>For medium-rare burgers, cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side.</li>
        <br>
        <li>For medium burgers, cook for about 5-6 minutes on each side.</li>
        <br>
        <li>For well-done burgers, cook for about 7-8 minutes on each side.</li>
        <br>
        <li>If you're adding cheese, place a slice on each patty during the last minute of cooking and cover to melt.</li>
        <br>
        <li>While the burgers are cooking, split the hamburger buns and toast them lightly on the grill or in a toaster until they're golden brown.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place a lettuce leaf on the bottom half of each bun, followed by a burger patty.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add slices of tomato and onion on top of the patty.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Optionally, add pickles for extra flavor.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Spread ketchup, mustard, or your preferred condiments on the top half of the buns.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place the top bun over the toppings to complete the burger.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place the top bun over the toppings to complete the burger.</li>

    </ol>
